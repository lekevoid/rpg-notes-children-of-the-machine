			"Then she notices a girl playing ballon-poire, but in a very unassuming way. She wants to win but she's closer to collapsing in desperation. Jamila tells Lucas to wish for ther to be more agressive, even angry. They see the girl's opponent actually get scared for a moment. The girl still loses, but she got a fight out of the opponent.",
			"Jamila excuses herself, says emotions have to be dealt with. She goes to join the girl. She tells Lucas that if he wants to know more about what he can do, he should come see her after class."

She suggests he can help in other ways. Most of the time, people can take care of themselves. All they need is a bit of love and care.",
